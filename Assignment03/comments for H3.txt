1.2(-2) Please use np.interp to ensure that the visualization matches the standard reference. Currently, there is no trend curve shown in the plot.

1.3 (-0) The result looks strange, but the logic of the code is correct. Could you please check the difference between your code and the following xarray approach:

location_methane = xch4.sel(lat=-15, lon=-150, method="nearest")
location_monthly_climatology = location_methane.groupby("time.month").mean(dim="time")
deseasonalized_methane = location_methane.groupby("time.month") - location_monthly_climatology
